The purpose of writing this Android APP is to avoid bordering of ads. Every time when we try to doing bookkeeping, we only need to open the APP, write down what we have spent / earned, then close it. The whole process may takes only several seconds. But many other APPs ask us see an ad when we open them. It is a waste of time.
